<h3>ADMISSION</h3>
      <p>
        Students having passed their "Prepa" exam constitute the main bunch of students joining ENISo. Computer Engineering Department offers an interesting "Applied Computer Science" and "Embedd Telco Engineering" program . Last ranks observed for admission of new comers (2016-2017) are around 300->1100 (for MP) and (100->400) for Techno and are getting better and better. 
      </p>
<h3>APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEER</h3>
<p>
    It's not about just coding... Applied computer engineers will be prepared to make use of different and exotic systems and platforms while being very software focused on web, mobile and distributed programming.
</p>
<h3>Embedded Telco Engineer</h3>
<p>This new program starts on 2017-2018 with a bunch of solely 20 students. Telecommunications is at the heart of today's technologies, and IoT (aka Internet of Things) is putting this even closer. GTE engineers will be well prepared not only for radio frequency paradigms and network concepts in telecommunications fields but also they would be a shrewd software, hardware programmers and embedded systems specialists.
</p>
<h3>Industrial electronics</h3>
<p>
    The Industrial Electronics track offers three different options in the third year:
<ul>
    <li>Industrial Control</li>
    <li>Design of electronic systems</li>
    <li>Embedded electronic systems</li>
</ul>
The engineer is generally competent in the fields of electronics, automation and electrical systems.
</p>
<h3>Mechatronics</h3>
<p>The mechatronics engineer is a multidisciplinary engineer, competent in the fields of mechanics, computer science, automation and electronics. Among the sectors of activity of these engineers are the automotive, aeronautics, robotics, industrial production machine tools, etc.

    The mechatronics section offers two options in the third year:
    <ul>
        <li>Mechatronic Systems Design</li>
        <li>Aerotechnics</li>
    </ul>
